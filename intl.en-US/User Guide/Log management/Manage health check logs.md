# Manage health check logs {#concept_dvm_dnn_vdb .concept}

You can view the health logs within three days on Health Check Logs page.  If you want to get the health check logs three days before or longer, you can store the health check logs to OSS. Therefore, you can download complete health check logs.

## Store health check logs {#section_xvc_fd4_vdb .section}

You can view the health check logs of the backend servers by using the health check log function. Currently, logs in three days are provided. If you want to view more logs, store the health check logs to OSS.

You can enable and disable the storage function at any time.  After the storage function is enabled, SLB will create a folder named AliyunSLBHealthCheckLogs in the selected bucket to store the health check logs. The health logs are generated hourly and the system will create a subfolder named after the date to store the log files generated in that day, for example 20170707.

The log files in a day are named after the time when they are generated. For example, the log file that is generated between 00:00-01:00, the file name will be 01.txt and the log file that is generated between 01:00-02:00, the file name will be 02.txt.

**Note:** The health check logs are generated only when the backend server is abnormal. Health check logs are generated only when the backend server is abnormal. If no failures occur for all the backend servers in an hour, no health check logs are generated in that hour.

To store health check logs, complete these steps:

1.  [Create a bucket](#section_tx2_td4_vdb)
2.  [Authorize SLB to access OSS](#section_y4n_3f4_vdb)
